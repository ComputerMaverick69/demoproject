# Git and GitHub

## Git
Git is a distributed version control system that helps developers track changes in their codebase and collaborate with others. It allows users to create branches to work on new features or fixes independently, merge changes back into the main codebase, and revert to previous versions if needed. Git operates locally on your machine, making it fast and efficient for managing code.

## GitHub
GitHub is a web-based platform built around Git that provides hosting for Git repositories. It offers a range of collaboration features such as pull requests, issues tracking, and project management tools. GitHub allows developers to easily share their code with others, contribute to open-source projects, and showcase their work. It has become a central hub for developers to collaborate and build software together.

In summary, Git is the version control system that tracks changes in code, while GitHub is a platform that hosts Git repositories and provides collaboration tools for developers.
